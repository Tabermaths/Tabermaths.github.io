  abstract = {Single-photon light detection and ranging (lidar) captures depth and intensity information of a 3D scene. Reconstructing a scene from observed photons is a challenging task due to spurious detections associated with background illumination sources. To tackle this problem, there is a plethora of 3D reconstruction algorithms which exploit spatial regularity of natural scenes to provide stable reconstructions. However, most existing algorithms have computational and memory complexity proportional to the number of recorded photons. This complexity hinders their real-time deployment on modern lidar arrays which acquire billions of photons per second. Leveraging a recent lidar sketching framework, we show that it is possible to modify existing reconstruction algorithms such that they only require a small sketch of the photon information. In particular, we propose a sketched version of a recent state-of-the-art algorithm which uses point cloud denoisers to provide spatially regularized reconstructions. A series of experiments performed on real lidar datasets demonstrates a significant reduction of execution time and memory requirements, while achieving the same reconstruction performance than in the full data case.},

  abstract = {In recent years, deep neural networks have obtained state-of-the-art performance in multiple imaging inverse problems ranging from medical imaging to computational photography. Networks are generally trained with pairs of signals and associated measurements. However, in various imaging problems, we usually only have access to compressed measurements of the underlying signals, hindering this learning-based approach. Learning from measurement data only is impossible in general, as the compressed observations do not contain information outside the range of the forward sensing operator. In this talk, I will present a new learning framework, called Equivariant Imaging, which overcomes this limitation by exploiting the invariance to transformations (translations, rotations, etc.) present in natural signals. I will also discuss necessary and sufficient conditions for learning without ground truth. Our proposed learning strategy performs as well as fully supervised methods and can handle noisy data. I will show results on various inverse problems, including sparse-view X-ray computed tomography, accelerated magnetic resonance imaging and image inpainting. },
