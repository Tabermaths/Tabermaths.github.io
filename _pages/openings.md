### PhD positions

[Jean-Yves Tourneret](https://perso.tesa.prd.fr/jyt/index.html) and myself are currently looking for candidates for a PhD position based at the TÃ©SA lab in Toulouse, in collaboration with the [CNES](https://cnes.fr/en). Please find the details about the project [here](https://recrutement.cnes.fr/fr/annonce/2038269-23-307-registration-and-fusion-of-3d-point-clouds-31500-toulouse). 



### Master Internships

 If you are interested in doing your master internship (M2) with us, send me an email to julian.tachella@cnrs.fr explaining the topics you would like to work on, your CV and a transcript of grades. To get an idea about our current research projects, please check out the [projects]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/projects.md %}) or [recent papers](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=u_hH-fUAAAAJ&hl=en). Projects usually involve both theory and applied work and require some knowledge in statistics, machine learning, signal processing and optimization.
