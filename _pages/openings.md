We are looking for highly motivated students who want to do cutting-edge research in machine learning and signal processing in a stimulating environent at ENSL, in the beautiful city of Lyon, France.

### Postdoc positions

We have one open postdoc position:

- I am looking for a postdoc as part of the [ANR UNLIP project](https://anr.fr/fr/detail/call/aapg-appel-a-projets-generique-2023/). The project will investigate new methods for self-supervised learning in non-linear imaging problems. Do not hesitate to contact me if you are interested in the position!


### Master Internships


We have a master open projects at ENS Lyon for Spring 2024 (with possible continuation into a PhD thesis):

- Self-Supervised Learning for Astronomical Imaging (with [Loic Denis](https://perso.univ-st-etienne.fr/deniloic/)). See the offer details [here](/assets/pdf/internship-offer-SelfSupLearning-Astro-Tachella-Denis.pdf).


 If you are interested in doing your master internship (M2) with us, send me an email to julian.tachella@cnrs.fr explaining the topics you would like to work on, your CV and a transcript of grades. To get an idea about our current research projects, please check out the [recent papers](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=u_hH-fUAAAAJ&hl=en). Projects usually involve both theory and applied work and require some knowledge in statistics, machine learning, signal processing and optimization.


### Visiting Researchers

We are happy to welcome visiting researchers that would like to work in the lab. If you are interested in spending some time in the lab, send me an email explaining the topics you would like to work on and your CV.
