### Master Internships

We are currently looking for highly motivated master students who want to do cutting-edge research in machine learning and signal processing at ENS Lyon. If you are interested in doing your master internship (M1 or M2) with us, send me an email to julian.tachella@cnrs.fr explaining the topics you would like to work on, your CV and a transcript of grades. To get an idea about our current research projects, please check out the [projects]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/projects.md %}) or [recent papers](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=u_hH-fUAAAAJ&hl=en). Projects usually involve both theory and applied work and require some knowledge in statistics, machine learning, signal processing and optimization.
