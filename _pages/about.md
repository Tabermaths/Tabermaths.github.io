I am a dual Ph.D. candidate at Heriot-Watt University and Université de Paris Cité, under the supervision of Dr. [Andres Almansa](https://helios2.mi.parisdescartes.fr/~aalmansa/HomePage/), Prof. [Julie Delon](https://judelo.github.io/), and Prof. [Marcelo Pereyra](https://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~mp71/index.html). 

My research focuses on developing stochastic quantitative imaging methods, particularly utilizing data-driven priors encoded by neural networks.

My academic journey commenced at the [African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS) Cameroon](https://aims-cameroon.org/), where I earned a Master's degree in Data Science under the guidance of Dr. [Nicolas Nusken](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/nikolas-nusken) and was honored as the 2021 Valedictorian. AIMS is a pan-African network of centers of excellence dedicated to postgraduate training in mathematical sciences, research, and public engagement in STEM fields.

My research lies at the intersection of  statistics,  machine learning and mathematics. I am particularly interested in leveraging contemporary artificial intelligence techniques to develop methodologies applicable to inverse problems across various scientific domains, including medical imaging. In essence, my work aims to harness AI to advance scientific discovery.

Specifically, I focus on robust uncertainty quantification in imaging inverse problems, automatic calibration and verification of statistical image models, and the development of scalable Bayesian computational algorithms derived from stochastic diffusion processes. I am committed to applying these methodologies to imaging challenges with significant social or environmental impact.

Dedicated to advancing quantitative imaging, my goal is to bridge the gap between complex mathematical theories and practical applications, thereby contributing to advancements in scientific understanding and technological innovation.
