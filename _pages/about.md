I am a CNRS researcher, working at the Sysiphe laboratory, École Normale Supérieure de Lyon, Lyon, France. My research lies at the intersection of signal processing and machine learning. I am particularly interested in both the theory of inverse problems and applications in computational imaging.

Before, I was a research associate in Mike Davies group at the University of Edinburgh (Edinburgh, UK) from 2020 to 2021. My research focused on unsupervised learning methods for solving inverse problems via deep neural networks, understanding the implicit bias of convolutional networks and sketching methods for single-photon lidar.

I did my PhD student at Heriot-Watt University (Edinburgh, UK) and TéSA lab (Toulouse, France) under the supervision of  Yoann Altmann, Jean-Yves Tourneret and Steve McLaughlin. My thesis studied Bayesian methods for inverse problems, with a particular interest in low-photon imaging applications.
