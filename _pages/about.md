I am a [CNRS](https://www.cnrs.fr/) researcher, working at the [Sisyphe laboratory](http://www.ens-lyon.fr/PHYSIQUE/teams/signaux-systemes-physique), [École Normale Supérieure de Lyon](http://www.ens-lyon.fr/) (Lyon, France). My research lies at the intersection of signal processing and machine learning. I am particularly interested in both the theory of inverse problems and applications in computational imaging.

Before, I did a postdoc in [Mike Davies group](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dwmfR3oAAAAJ&hl=en) at the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/) (Edinburgh, UK). My research focused on unsupervised learning methods for solving inverse problems via deep neural networks, understanding the implicit bias of convolutional networks and sketching methods for single-photon lidar.

I did my PhD student at [Heriot-Watt University](https://www.hw.ac.uk/) (Edinburgh, UK) and [TéSA lab](https://www.tesa.prd.fr/) (Toulouse, France) under the supervision of [Yoann Altmann](https://yoannaltmann.weebly.com/), [Jean-Yves Tourneret](http://tourneret.perso.enseeiht.fr/) and [Steve McLaughlin](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=z9wnHv8AAAAJ&hl=en). My thesis studied Bayesian methods for inverse problems, with a particular interest in low-photon imaging applications.
