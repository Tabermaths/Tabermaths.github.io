From December 2021, I am a CNRS researcher, working at the Sysiphe laboratory, École Normale Supérieure de Lyon, Lyon, France. My research lies in the intersection of inverse problems and machine learning (and deep learning in particular). I am particularly interested unsupervised training strategies for solving imaging inverse problems.

Before, I was a research associate in Prof. Mike Davies group at the University of Edinburgh (Edinburgh, UK) from 2020 to 2021. My research focused on unsupervised learning methods for solving inverse problems via deep neural networks, understanding the implicit bias of convolutional networks and sketching methods for single-photon lidar.

I was a PhD student at Heriot-Watt University (Edinburgh, UK) and TéSA lab (Toulouse, France) under the supervision of Dr. Yoann Altmann, Prof. Jean-Yves Tourneret and Prof. Steve McLaughlin. My PhD thesis focused on Bayesian methods for inverse problems, with a particular interest in low-photon imaging applications.
