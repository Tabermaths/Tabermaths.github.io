This site contains information about the tutorial on self-supervised learning for imaging, given by [Mike Davies](https://www.eng.ed.ac.uk/about/people/professor-michael-e-davies) and me.
The tutorial is part of the [EUSIPCO 2024 conference](https://eusipcolyon.sciencesconf.org/resource/page/id/28) on the 26/08/2024 in Lyon, France.

**Slides**: The slides of the tutorial will be uploaded here after the conference.

**Code**: Self-supervised learning demos [here](https://deepinv.github.io/deepinv/auto_examples/index.html#self-supervised-learning).


**Abstract**: This tutorial will cover core concepts and recent advances in the emerging field of self-supervised
learning methods for solving imaging inverse problems with deep neural networks.
Self-supervised learning is a fundamental tool deploying deep learning solutions in scientific and medical
imaging applications where obtaining a large dataset of ground-truth images is very expensive or impossible.
The tutorial will provide a comprehensive summary of different self-supervised methods, 
discuss their theoretical underpinnings and present practical self-supervised imaging applications.
